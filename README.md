# Operating-Platforms
The client, The Gaming Room, requested software to support a web-based game that could run across multiple platforms. The software needed to handle user accounts, manage multiple concurrent games, and ensure consistent performance.

# My Strengths
One Area I did particularly well in was documenting teh software requirements clearly and translating them into design elements. I focused on making the design understandable both for developers and for non-technical stakeholders.

# Helpful Aspects of the Process
The design document process was very helpful in breaking the project into smaller structured parts. Thinking through class diagrams, requirements, and constraints before coding made it easier to stay organized and avoid unnecessary redesign later.

# Areas for Improvement
If I could revise one part of my work, I would refine the section on scalability. I would add more detail on how the system could handle future growth, such as expanding user traffic or supporting additional features.

# Understanding User Needs
I made sure to align the design with user needs by focusing on accessibility, ease of use, and reliability. Considering the user's perspective is critical, because it ensures the final product not only works technically but also delivers a smooth and enjoyable experience.

# Design Approach
In designing the software, I used a combination of UML diagrams, modular design principles, and clear separation of concerns. In the future, I would continue to use these strategies, along with iterative feedback loops, to make sure the design stays aligned with both client goals and user expecatations
